# RestaurantProject
Restaurant management project, done by myself and another 11 teammates for our [Software Engineering](http://web.fdi.ucm.es/UCMFiles/pdf/FICHAS_DOCENTES/2022/6876.pdf)/[Software Modelling](http://web.fdi.ucm.es/UCMFiles/pdf/FICHAS_DOCENTES/2022/6605.pdf) classes.

This project was made on IBM RSAD, where we first modelled the project and then, using the program's tool, transformed it into code.

The project consists of 3 main parts: Documentation, Modelling and Code.

## Documentation
This part contains the Software System Requirements file (also known as SRS) and the project memory, in which we included the patterns used in the project, as well as screenshots of the project.

## Modelling
We did both class and sequence diagrams of all 3 layers of the project (Integration, Modelling and Presentation), which described the structure and behavior of the program, then we transformed these models into code.

## Code
Lastly, we have the working project. It was written in Java and as explained before, we applied different patterns. The code is divided in Integration (functions that connect to the Database and other resources), Business (where we add the logic and client premises) and Presentation (where all the information fetched by the Integration and processed by the Business layer is displayed).
We also performed unit testing, in the Tests folder, we used JUnit testing to do so.
